* 1 built-in dismiss animation.
* You can easily create custom layouts and animations.

## Getting started


## Motions

### Behind Motion

The actions appear as if they where behind the `Slidable`:

![Behind Motion][behind_motion]

### Drawer Motion

Animate the actions as if they were drawers, when the `Slidable` is moving:

![Drawer Motion][drawer_motion]

### Scroll Motion

The actions follow the `Slidable` while it's moving:

![Scroll Motion][scroll_motion]

### Stretch Motion

Animate the actions as if they were streched while the `Slidable` is moving:

![Stretch Motion][stretch_motion]
